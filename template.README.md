# Required R Packages

The list of packages used in this project is not provided. We would rather suggest you to run this project inside the [Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pokyah/agrometeordocker/) in which it was developed. All the required packages will come pre-installed and will be automatically loaded from `init.R`
